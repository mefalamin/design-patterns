# Design Pattern
This repo contains design patterns which were on my study list.


## What is design pattern ?
Design patterns are well tested and general solution to common problems in software development. A pattern is a guideline for 
flexible and resilient code design.


## Where did design patterns come from?
Design patterns were originally invented by four software designers Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides.
These are collectively known as Gang of Four (GOF) in the software world. They have created 
twenty-three design patterns. These twenty-three patterns have expanded to many more by other 
software developers all around the world.


## Why we need design pattern ?
To deal with the change. For example to change in softwa re like

1. Adding new feature.....
2. There's change in the spec...
3. We've found a bug :anguished: 

By learning design pattern and applying them in your object-oriented designs
you can create more flexible and maintainable code :)


## How to use Design Patterns
A design pattern is not a library, module or package. It's a guideline for how to solve a 
particular problem while designing or writing your code. Think of a pattern is a higher level
library or module. That does not mean that library or module don't use pattern, they often do.
When it comes to your design, you have to understand the pattern and adapt it to your code.
